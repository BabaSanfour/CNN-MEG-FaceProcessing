# Project Overview

Welcome to the scripts used in Modeling the Face recognition system in the brain 

This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, focusing on face recognition dynamics. Inspired by artificial neural networks surpassing human performance, the study investigates whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for face recognition mimic the neural dynamics of face recognition in the human brain. Utilizing Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and comparing activations across seven CNNs, the research leverages high temporal resolution and source reconstruction techniques to unveil spatio-temporal similarity patterns. The study contributes novel insights into the complex interplay between artificial and biological neural responses associated with face recognition.
